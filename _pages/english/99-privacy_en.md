The following text has to be included in sites provided from Germany by German citicens, due to our sometimes strange, inconsistent and user-unfriendly data privacy laws.

# Privacy Statement
## Scope

This privacy statement informs users about the nature, scope and purpose of the collection and use of personal data by the responsible provider Dr. Peter Hruschka, Langenbruchweg 71, D-52080 Aachen, Germany, Tel.: +49 172 241 1656 on this website (hereinafter referred to as "Offer").

The legal basis for data protection can be found in the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG).

## Access data/ Server log files

The provider (or his web space provider) collects data about each access to the offer (so-called server log files). The access data includes:

Name of the accessed website, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.

The provider uses the log data only for statistical analysis for the purpose of operation, security and optimization of the offer. However, the provider reserves the right to subsequently check the log data if there is a justified suspicion of unlawful use due to concrete indications.

## Contacting

When contacting the provider (for example, via contact form or e-mail), the user's details are stored for the purpose of processing the request and in the event that follow-up questions arise.

## Comments and contributions

When users leave comments on the blog or other contributions, their IP addresses are stored. This is done for the security of the provider, in case someone writes illegal content in comments and posts (insults, prohibited political propaganda, etc.). In this case, the provider itself can be prosecuted for the comment or post and is therefore interested in the identity of the author.

## Analysis, tracking and cookies
This site does not use tracking to determine access numbers and does not use cookies.

## Revocation, changes, corrections and updates

The user has the right to obtain, upon request and free of charge, information about the personal data stored about him. In addition, the user has the right to correct incorrect data, blocking and deletion of his personal data, provided that this does not conflict with any legal obligation to retain data.
