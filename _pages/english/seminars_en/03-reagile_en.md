<div class="splash_text" markdown="1"> 

Successful products and projects satisfy the **real needs of your users**. In this workshop, you will learn how to identify and prioritize these needs and bring solutions to market quickly.

In your role as product owner, business analyst or requirements engineer, you will become the ideal partner for agile development teams and a guarantor of success for your company.

Today, good requirements no longer means writing thick requirements specifications, but rather constantly collecting, structuring and evaluating requirements so that the features that deliver the greatest business value can be quickly implemented in products.

<hr class="blue-sep">

With the help of many examples and practical tips, you will learn **everything you need in your everyday life** to master the requirements of agile projects.
Even without prerequisites you will be ready after the training,
to successfully manage the requirements of your stakeholders as a product owner. You will know
how to set goals and specify them step by step, so that you can prove the success of your work early on.
We supplement the methodical content with even more practical tips and deepen the handling of the often neglected quality requirements.
You learn how to estimate the effort required for implementation,
which strategies can be used for prioritization and how Agile Requirements Engineering can be used for large,
possibly distributed projects.

# Content:
* **Agile methods and requirements engineering - two ideal partners**.  
  You'll learn how to balance rapid product success with solid requirements. How you can save thick documents if you communicate appropriately and often instead. Agile requirements are just-in-time requirements. As much precision as necessary, but as little detail as possible.

* **Guarantees for a successful project start**.  
  Learn to make your vision and goals explicit, know your stakeholders and define the planned scope of your project.

* **Mastering functional requirements**  
  Learn techniques, practices, tips & tricks for handling Epics, Features and Stories. How to structure them, how to document and communicate them.

* **Mastering non-functional requirements**.  
  You will be able to assess the importance of quality requirements for product success and learn how to deal with qualities and constraints in an agile environment.

* **Prioritize and plan**  
  Sie lernen Business Value Maximierung und Risikoreduzierung. Wie sortiert man den Backlog, um frühzeitig den größten Nutzen zu produzieren? Wie geht man mit Abhängigkeiten um? Sie lernen, wie man Aufwand und Nutzen abgleicht.

* **The practical handling of quality requirements**.  
  You will deepen your basic knowledge of quality requirements and learn practical tips for dealing with them in a time-saving and targeted manner.

* **Estimate and Plan**  
  You will learn agile estimation methods such as Planning Poker and Wall Estimation. You will be able to weigh costs and efforts against benefits.

* **Strategies for product development**
  You will learn how to generate rapid initial successes via MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and MMPs (Minimum Marketable Products). How do you select the appropriate features for this? How do you ensure that development does not go in the wrong direction?

* **Think big!**  
  You will learn how to deal with large projects and distributed teams. How can agile requirements methods be scaled in the company? Which ideas can you adopt from popular scaling frameworks like SAFe, LeSS or Nexus? Your way from a successful agile project to a successful agile organization!

* **Exam Preparation**  
  We review everything you need to know for the Advanced Level exam "RE@Agile". From 15:00 you can take [the first part of the exam](/en/ireb-certifications) (the multiple choice test) directly.


# Prerequisites:
<small> recommended, but not mandatory! </small>

* Scrum training or adequate knowledge from practical experience.
* Basic knowledge of requirements engineering, ideally CPRE FL training.

# IREB Advanced Level Certification

This course enables you to certify to the **IREB** Advanced Level Module **"RE@Agile "**. The [exam](/en/ireb-certifications)
can be taken directly at the end of the workshop - or independently.

The prerequisite for taking the exam is the IREB CPRE certificate.
If you do not have this yet, you can acquire it through our two-day workshop
["Requirements Basics"](/en/requirements-basics).
As a convenient alternative, the [video training by Peter Hruschka](https://www.aschauerit.at/re35-videotraining-ba-re-nach-ireb/)
prepares you for the CPRE exam independent of time.
